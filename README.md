# Zotero HTML Report Parser

A Python script that extracts bibliographic information from Zotero collection report HTML files and converts them to clean, structured JSON format.

## What it does

This tool takes a Zotero collection report (HTML format) and extracts key bibliographic information into a JSON file with the following structure:

```json
[
  {
    "title": "Article Title",
    "author(s)": "LastName and SecondLastName", 
    "year": "2023",
    "journal": "Journal Name",
    "abstract": "Article abstract text..."
  }
]
```

## Features

- ðŸ“„ Parses HTML collection reports from Zotero
- ðŸ‘¥ Smart author formatting (last names only, "et al" for >2 authors)
- ðŸ“… Extracts year from various date formats
- ðŸ§¹ Removes line breaks and cleans text
- ðŸ“š Handles multiple publication types (articles, books, conference papers)
- âš¡ Fast and reliable HTML parsing

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Zotero desktop application

## Installation

1. **Clone this repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/zotero-html-parser.git
   cd zotero-html-parser
   ```

2. **Install required Python packages:**
   ```bash
   pip install beautifulsoup4
   ```

## Usage

### Step 1: Generate HTML Report from Zotero

1. Open Zotero desktop application
2. Select the collection you want to export
3. Right-click on the collection â†’ **"Generate Report from Collection"**
4. Zotero will open a new window/tab with the report

### Step 2: Save Report as HTML

1. In the report window, save the page as HTML:
   - **Windows/Linux:** Press `Ctrl + S`
   - **Mac:** Press `Cmd + S`
2. In the save dialog:
   - Choose "Web Page, HTML Only" or "HTML File" format
   - Save as `"Zotero Report 1.html"` (or update the filename in the script)
   - Remember the location where you saved it

### Step 3: Run the Parser

1. **Place the HTML file** in the same directory as `zotero_parser.py`

2. **Run the script:**
   ```bash
   python zotero_parser.py
   ```

3. **Output:** The script will create `zotero_literature.json` with your parsed bibliography

## Example Output

```json
[
  {
    "title": "Simulation in Logistics: A Review of Present Practice and a Look to the Future",
    "author(s)": "Bowersox and Closs",
    "year": "1989",
    "journal": "Journal of Business Logistics",
    "abstract": "Simulation is a widely used methodology in logistics planning. This article compares simulation technology..."
  },
  {
    "title": "Verification and validation of simulation models",
    "author(s)": "Kleijnen",
    "year": "1995",
    "journal": "European Journal of Operational Research",
    "abstract": "This paper surveys verification and validation of models, especially simulation models in operations research..."
  }
]
```

## Author Formatting Rules

- **1 author:** `"Smith"`
- **2 authors:** `"Smith and Jones"`
- **3+ authors:** `"Smith et al"`

## Customization

### Change Input/Output Files

Edit these variables in `zotero_parser.py`:

```python
html_path = "Your Report Name.html"    # Input HTML file
output_path = "your_output.json"       # Output JSON file
```

### Add More Fields

To extract additional fields, modify the `parse_article()` function. Look for field names in the HTML table structure.

## Troubleshooting

### "File not found" error
- Ensure the HTML file is in the same directory as the script
- Check that the filename matches exactly (case-sensitive)

### No articles found
- Verify you saved the report as HTML format (not PDF)
- Make sure you're using a Zotero collection report, not an individual item

### Missing abstracts/fields
- Some Zotero entries may not have all fields - this is normal
- Check your original Zotero entries to see what data is available

## Requirements

The script requires:
- `beautifulsoup4` - for HTML parsing
- `json` - for output formatting (built-in)
- `re` - for text processing (built-in)
